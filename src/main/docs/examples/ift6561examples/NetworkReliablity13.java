/**
 * This class simulates a static reliability model using the same network as for
 * the specific San13 example with 9 nodes and 13 links, taken from Elmaghraby
 * (1977). The goal here is to estimate the probability that nodes 1 and 9 are
 * disconnected. This program is very specific to this example and uses a very
 * naive way to compute the shortest path, by enumerating all six paths! Here
 * the links are numbered from 0 to 12.
