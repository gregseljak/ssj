/**
 * Class implementing *order dependent weights.* This means that the weights are
 * indexed by integers representing the order of the coordinate projection for
 * which they are defined. More precisely all projections onto coordinate sets
 * of the same cardinality are assigned the same weight @f$\gamma_{\mathfrak u}
 * = \Gamma_{|\mathfrak u|}@f$. For instance, the projection onto the
 * coordinates @f$(x_1,x_2,x_3)@f$ is assigned the same weight as every other
 * projection of three variables, such as @f$(x_2,x_4,x_6)@f$. Mind that the
 * order (i.e., the index of the @ref SingletonWeightComparable) is at least 1
 * for non-empty projections. This should be considered when adding weights.
 * 
 * Weights of this type are supported by LatNet Builder and they can be put into
 * the right format for this purpose by #toLatNetBuilder. If needed, also the
 * possibility to write these weights to a file is offered, which is also
 * readable by LatNet Builder.
