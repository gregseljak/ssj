 * This abstract class implements generic weights that can be used to search for
 * good quasi-Monte Carlo point sets such as @ref Rank1Lattice, @ref DigitalNet,
 * etc. via search tools like *LatNet Builder.* The template parameter 'T'
 * indicates the data type of the underlying index. Common choices are integers
 * (e.g. the order for @ref OrderDependentWeights, @ref CoordinateSet for @ref
 * ProjectionDependentWeights, etc.). The abstract method #toLatNetBuilder is
 * used to communicate with the commandline tool of LatNet Builder.
