/**
 * This @ref PointSetRandomization class provides the nested uniform scrambling
 * (NUS) randomization proposed by Owen (\cite vOWE95a, \cite vOWE03a) for
 * digital nets. Since the scrambled points are all stored explicitly, it can
 * only be applied to a @ref CachedPointSet that contains a @ref
 * DigitalNetBase2. The proper way to use it is to construct a @ref
 * CachedPointSet `p` that contains the digital net, and call @ref
 * NestedUniformScrambling.randomize(p) to randomize. The actual implementation
 * is in @ref DigitalNetBase2.nestedUniformScramble().
 *
 * Note that calling CachedPointSet.randomize() with an instance of
 * NestedUniformScrambling as its arguments will not work, because
 * CachedPointSet.randomize() calls randomize() on its reference point set (the
 * digital net) whereas NUS should modify the cached values instead.
